            <h2>Critical Terms</h2>
            <div class="term">
              <p class="bold">Computation</p>
              <p class="italic">As defined by Stephen Wolfram</p>
              <p>A computation is an operation that begins with some initial conditions and gives an output which follows from a definite set of rules. The most common example are computations performed by computers, in which the fixed set of rules may be the functions provided by a particular programming language.
                The field of computer science studies the nature of computation and its uses, among other things. A set of rules used to carry out a computation is known as an algorithm.</p>
